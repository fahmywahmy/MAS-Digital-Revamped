# Setup — MAS Digital Revamped

> Covers **only what runs today** (the data layer). This grows as features land — it
> will never document a step that doesn't work yet (`CLAUDE.md §2.5`).

## Prerequisites

- **Node 20+**, **Python 3.12+**, and a **Supabase** project.
- A network with **outbound Postgres (5432/6543)**. Some corporate networks block these
  (TCP timeout to the pooler) — if `db:deploy` times out, switch to a hotspot/home
  network. (HTTPS/git keep working; only Postgres ports are blocked.)

## 1. Clone + configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahmywahmy/MAS-Digital-Revamped.git
cd MAS-Digital-Revamped
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in Supabase + Anthropic values
```

The repo loads its **own** `.env` at the repo root — never `../.env`.

## 2. Install

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Apply the database schema

```bash
npm run db:deploy             # applies prisma/migrations (0000_init + 0001_pgvector)
npm run db:status             # should report: "Database schema is up to date!"
```

For a **fresh or dirty** database, clear it first (⚠️ **destructive — wipes all data**):

```bash
python scripts/reset-db.py    # drops app tables/enums/functions; keeps extensions
npm run db:deploy
```

## 4. Verify the data layer

```bash
python scripts/verify-db.py   # expect 36 tables, pgvector present, clean 2-migration ledger
```

## 5. Python toolchain + LLM gateway

The tools (and the LLM gateway) run on Python 3.12. Install into a repo-root venv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows; use .venv/bin/pip on POSIX
```

Then prove the gateway + cost ledger end-to-end (makes real, sub-cent Claude calls;
needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/prove-gateway.py
```

Expect: two `CostLog` rows with non-zero cost, an accumulating `AgentRun` total, and a
third call aborted by the kill-switch. The script provisions and then deletes its own
disposable rows.

All Claude calls go through `tools/utils/claude_client.py` — the only file allowed to
import `anthropic` (CI-enforced). See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) →
"Cost & observability".

## 6. Run the content vertical

The content pipeline is defined by one manifest, `pipelines/content.yaml`. Prove it
end-to-end for a disposable brand (real Opus calls, ~$0.09):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/run-content-pipeline.py
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/run-content-pipeline.py --seed "eid travel deals" --keep
```

Expect: an `AgentRun` that COMPLETED with real cost, a persisted `ContentPiece` +
`ContentCopy`, and an eval-gate verdict (≥18/25 → `IN_REVIEW`, else `FAILED`). Check the
manifest is drift-free (no DB/LLM needed):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/check-pipeline-drift.py
```

## What's NOT here yet

The durable job queue (Procrastinate — runs are synchronous today), the remaining tool
verticals (seo / paid / community), and the webapp/console are not built yet — see
[`../PORTING_PLAN.md`](../PORTING_PLAN.md). `Launch Webapp.bat` will print "webapp not
found" until the webapp lands (porting order section D, step 5).
